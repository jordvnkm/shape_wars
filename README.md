# Shape Wars

Shape wars is a completely front end JavaScript game that focuses on object oriented design.  The different moving objects inherit from a main moving_object base class.  The objects are rendered using HTML5 and Canvas.  The canvas object is rendered and manipulated once loaded using JQUERY.
